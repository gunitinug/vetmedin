*Daily chores checklist*

I made this bash script that uses jq and whiptail to keep track of daily chores.

To run this script just execute run.sh.

This script requires jq and whiptail installed.

data.json file is populated by (1st and 10th day of month) each in months feb, april, jun, aug, oct, dec for years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022.
